Good morning, teachers, I am honoured to have this opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is ABC.Â I graduated from Nanjing University of Post and Telecommunications with a degree in Material Physics.
 As a freshman, I passed CET4 and CET6 and in the first place, had a very strong interest in computer technology. 
So I participated in a student club and, with them, learned many techniques. 
During my senior year, I became the head of the club, built a team making many tiny games with Unity, 
created a website based on Python for members to upload their codes, painting works and models, 
comments and follows each others just like a social network, and also used this web for club propaganda and future recruitment work. 
Two years of experience, Making me an idea to join into the computer section in the future of my life, 
meanwhile, making me an idea that the few knowledge that I had at present through self-study is not enough to let me plunge into the sea and ride the tide. 
I sincerely require a chance for further study. 
That is the reason I am here. And that`s all my self-introduction. 
Thank you for listening.
